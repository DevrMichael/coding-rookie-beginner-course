## Getting Started with Create React App

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a solid foundation for building React applications with best practices and optimized build configurations.

### Available Scripts

To immerse yourself in the learning experience, here are the primary commands you'll use:

- **`npm start`**: Launches the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your progress live. The page will automatically reload as you apply changes.

- **`npm test`**: Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder. This process optimizes the build for the best performance, resulting in a minified version of your application, ready for deployment.

- **`npm run eject`**: Provides an escape hatch for developers wanting more control over configuration files and build tools. **Note**: This is a permanent action.

### PrismJS for Code Snippets

PrismJS is integrated to enhance the learning experience with beautifully highlighted code snippets. This tool makes it easier to follow along with coding examples and exercises.

### React Vimeo for Video Content

Leveraging React Vimeo, our course includes video lessons that complement the written content and coding exercises. This integration ensures a diverse learning experience that caters to different learning preferences.
